Property tax is significant. 37% of the 2025 King County general fund came from property taxes, and over 25% of Seattle’s operating budget. I believe that our method of assessing property tax is antiquated and unnecessarily discourages development. Current practice in King County, in addition to the entire country, (? I believe???) is to assess property values by combining the value of the land, the value of the ‘improvements’, unceremoniously adding them together without weighing either land value or improvement value as more important, and then charging that years tax based on the sum. The improvements on the land - meaning the value of any and all structures on that land - are often assessed at dramatically higher values than the land itself.

Here in Seattle we are cursed with the blessing of being located on an isthmus! We are bound by water to the east and west and are thus unable to sprawl. This situation means that we have to look inward to accommodate our seemingly insatiable growth demand. There have been many articles published about both our needs to add housing and our various successes and failures. 

Our tax system by nature discourages development because when a property owner builds on their property - their tax bill jumps. Often dramatically. The most extreme case in terms of raw improvements is [Onni South Lake Union](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=2693100068) located on Denny/Boren in South Lake Union. This building occupies a lot of 55,000 square feet, or 1.26 acres. The improvements on the lot were assessed at a staggering $714,577,100 in 2022 while the lot itself was valued at $49,531,500. This means that with a total tax rate of $9.19418 the owner of the lot pays a staggering $7,025,352 in tax, $6,569,950 of which is derived from the improvement values. There are approximately 827 units in the tower meaning tenants pay over $700 per month per unit in property tax, about 95% of which is derived from the assessed improvements. 

### Taking this to the rest of the city

The numbers pertaining to Onni SLU and many other office and residential buildings in the most valuable parts of the city are indeed enormous, but that iss actually not what my gripe is really about. Nearly all of the parcels with the highest amounts of assessed improvements are located in the most desirable parts of the city where people will pay top dollar to be. I believe that our tax code should continue to tax those parcels at extremely high rates, not because their structures are so impressive, but because the land is so valuable.

The effects of the current property tax system are also extremely significant in more residential parts of Seattle. Take a look at a couple of maps I made comparing the Appraised Land Value and the Appraised Improvement value.

This map showing the appraised land value by hexagons throughout the city displays that the highest land values are where you would expect. Land located in Downtown, South Lake Union and the U-District is taxed at a higher rate than other land around the city.

But now take a look at this map showing the improved upon value of that same land. The disparity between the high value areas is dramatically larger than the disparity between land values. I believe that this is a symptom of our tax code. Why would a developer make an extravagant building for any purpose on less valuable land when the valuation will be nearly entirely based upon the improvements whether it be downtown or on the outskirts?

Lets take a closer look at some of the lots that 


Across the street from Roosevelt High School there is a vacant, commercial, lot owned by a property developer. The 13302(?) of Land is valued at a shade under $5.5 million and the improvements are a big fat 0, making the total taxable property value $5,453,800. Check out the county parcel page here. On the very same block there is a slightly smaller lot of size 11758(?)







I do want to acknowledge programs such as the MFTE (Multifamily Tax Exemption) which provides residential buildings with large tax breaks encouraging housing development. For example the [CityLine](https://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/Dashboard.aspx?ParcelNbr=2224049089) development next to the Columbia City Station only pays property tax on the land value and not the appraised improvements, saving them over double of their current tax bill. 


The Center Line Apartments next to Roosevelt High provide 156,573 square feet of housing space with a taxable total of $6,535,100 down from the $86,099,360 it was in 2021 without the MFTE. See the parcel page here.



Gas Stations and the Like

A huge beneficiary of the current system are businesses who operate with underdeveloped land. Nobody looks at a gas station and thinks ‘what an amazing victory of architecture!’. The King County assessor agrees and values the improvements made upon the land that Gas Stations sit at an average of 23% of the land value. For context 



Another egregious beneficiary of current property tax codes are private clubs such as the Seattle Tennis Club and Broadmoor who
